The [playlist filter](https://github.com/OlesenJonas/PlaylistFilterForSpotify) is a hobby project that I created to discover more about / play around with my spotify likes.
It loads various data for all tracks in a given playlist and then enables filtering, sorting and graphing the songs based on exactly that data. Additionally the program can call some of Spotify's functionality to e.g: recommend similar songs to a selection made by the user.

It was a nice change of pace to write some non-graphics C++ and do a little bit of optimization, multi-threading on the CPU for once. In addition to working with a web API through libcpr.
